Lizzie finally making some notes on what's in the folder 

Looking for Lemoine PGLS? 
>> git/teaching/gelmanhill/BayesPGLS/pgls.R
>> git/teaching/gelmanhill/BayesPGLS/pgls_lemoine.stan


max_sims.R from Max Farrell

notes-from-a-small-island.R -- From Will Pearse, something like PGLS I think ... see pmm_emails.txt

Pearse-code-4brmsdata.R -- Nacho's code trying to run Will's early (spring 2020) models

pmm-pgls-simulations_v2.R -- original code from Simon Joly

pmm-pgls-simulations_v2IMC.R -- edits to Joly code for our purposes


run_MCMCbrms_pglmm_nointra.R  -- my edits to Joly code to remove intraspecific covariance matrix ... I think superseded by pmm-pgls-simulations_v2IMC.R  (but should check)

run_MCMCbrms_pglmm.R -- edits to Joly code for our purposes, compares MCMCglmm and brms

uberlessmini.R -- similar to ubermini.R but puts phylo on intercept.

ubermini.R -- my original code to test Will's model, simple test data with intercept of 0, and just slope (with phylo on slope) on linear model

ubermini_2.R -- Will's new attempt in late August 2020

uberpgls.R -- my attempts to write PGLS code, not successful yet.
