Working on models of late and early burst ... 


burstdeltamodels/simulate_fit_uber_threeslopeintercept_simdelta.R is simulate_fit_uber_threeslopeintercept.R but:
1) Sets up some traits with a delta model of evolution, but then runs our general PMM (with sigma and lambda) on the simulated data to see how delta models manifest (short answer -- they show up in sigma). See also https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/pmm/issues/22 for this.
