Files checking on pulling out the granmeans:
	oneslopeinterceptcholforsync_grandmean.stan (pulls out intercept)
	oneslopeinterceptcholforsync_grandmeans.stan (pulls out intercept and slope)


Not functional code where Mike jotted down some example code of: (1) making our phylogeny model include a nested level and (2) showing how to vectorize code. I added some notes but otherwise have not touched this. 
	oneslopeinterceptcholforsync_withMike.stan
